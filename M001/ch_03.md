## Chapter 3: Deeper Dive on the MongoDB Query Language

Query operators: element operators, logical operators, array operators, and the regex operator

For which CRUD operations can one use the query operators we will discuss in this chapter? **ALL of them**.

Given that _upserts_ are a form of create operation, all CRUD operations can make use of a filter. The query operators we are going to discuss in this chapter are used in filters.

#### Comparison Operators

Filter for all movies with a `runtime` greater than 90 minutes.

```
db.movieDetails.find({runtime: {$gt: 90}})
```

For `runtime` greater than 90 minutes and less than 120 minutes:

```
db.movies.find({runtime: { $gt: 90, $lt: 120 }})
```

For `runtime` greater than _or equal to_ 90 minutes and less than _or equal to_ 120 minutes (with projection):

```
db.movieDetails.find({runtime: {$gte: 90, $lte: 120}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1})
```

Mixing things up...

```
db.movieDetails.find({runtime: {$gte: 180}, "tomato.meter": 95}, {_id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1})
```

Filtering on _not equal_ (`$ne`). Example: finding movies whos rating is anything other than 'UNRATED':

```
db.movieDetails.find({rated: {$ne: "UNRATED"}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, rated: 1})
```

filtering on one or more values, any one of which will cause a document to be returned: `$in`. The value of `$in` must be an array. Select all documents where the value of `rated` is "G" or "PG":

```
db.movieDetails.find({rated: {$in: ["G", "PG"]}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, rated: 1})
```

Extend the filter by adding more elements to the array:

```
db.movieDetails.find({rated: {$in: ["G", "PG", "PG-13"]}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, rated: 1}).pretty()
```

The oppose it `$nin` - _not in_:

```
db.movieDetails.find({rated: {$nin: ["R"]}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, rated: 1}).pretty()
```

#### Element Operators

Test for the existence of a rating:

```
db.moviesDetails.find({mpaaRating: {$exists: true}})
```

Match documents that do NOT contain a `mpaaRating` key:

```
db.moviesDetails.find({mpaaRating: {$exists: false}})
```

Find documents that either have `mpaaRating: null` or do not contain the `mpaaRating` key at all:

```
db.movieDetails.find({mpaaRating: null})
```

Filter for documents that have a particular value type for a field using the `$type` operator. For example, match only document that have a value type for `viewerRating` that is a 32-bit integer:

```
db.movies.find({viewerRating: {$type: "int"}}).pretty()
```

Or look for just doubles instead:

```
db.movies.find({viewerRating: {$type: "double"}}).pretty()
```

#### Logical Operators

Focus on `$or` and `$and`. There's also `$not` and `$nor` operators.

`$or` takes an array in which we specify selectors. Any one of which can be true to match a query.

Example of `$or`. Look for docs based on their rating using both their tomato meter and the metacritic score. We're looking for docs with a tomato.meter greater than 95 and a metacritic score greater than 88:

```
db.movieDetails.find(
  { $or: [
    { "tomato.meter" : { $gt : 95 }},
    { "metacritic"   : { $gt : 88 }}
  ]},
  { _id: 0, title: 1, "tomato.meter": 1, "metacritic": 1}
)
```

`$and` - _both_ conditions must be true. Selectors in a filter are implicitly anded together by default.

```
db.movieDetails.find(
  { $and: [
    { "tomato.meter" : { $gt : 95 }},
    { "metacritic"   : { $gt : 88 }}
  ]},
  { _id : 0, title : 1, "tomato.meter" : 1, "metacritic" : 1}
)
```

... is the same as ...

```
db.movieDetails.find(
  { "tomato.meter" : { $gt : 95 },
    "metacritic"   : { $gt : 88 }
  },
  { _id : 0, title : 1, "tomato.meter" : 1, "metacritic" : 1 }
  )
```

So why is there a `$and` operator? It allows us to apply multiple constraints on the same field. What if we want to check that both `metacritic` exists and it not set to `null`:

```
db.movieDetails.find(
  { $and : [
    { "metacritic" : { $ne     : null }},
    { "metacritic" : { $exists : true }}
  ]},
  { _id : 0, title : 1, "metacritic" : 1 }
)
```

Flip that - find all documents where `metacritic` exists _and_ is set to `null`:

```
db.movieDetails.find(
  { $and : [
    { "metacritic" : null },
    { "metacritic" : { $exists : true }}
  ]},
  { _id: 0, title : 1, "metacritic" : 1 }
)
```

In our class Atlas cluster, ships.shipwrecks collection... `watlev` describes the water level at the shipwreck site and `depth` describes how far below sea level the ship rests. How many documents in the `ships.shipwrecks` collection match either of the following criteria: `watlev` equal to "always dry" or `depth` equal to 0?

```
db.shipwrecks.find(
  {
    $or : [
      { watlev : 'always dry' },
      { depth  : 0 }
    ]
  }
).count()
```

#### Array Operators: $all
