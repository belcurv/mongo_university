Quiz: Challenge Problem: Create Movie Entries

Start with one of the handouts from this week. The handouts from the "All Together Now" lesson and the "Express: Handling POST Requests" lesson might provide the best starting points.

Write a Node.js web application that presents users with a form containing three fields and a submit button. The fields should be:

    title
    year
    imdb

Set up a route to handle a POST request of this form. This route should use the Node.js MongoDB driver to insert a movie document into MongoDB. The movie document should have the same shape as those we looked at in lesson examples this week.

Check that you are inserting records correctly in the Mongo shell with some find() commands.
